# PL_Course_HW2
Task #2 from the Programming Languages coruse at Afeka Engineering.
The task demonstrate the use of Iterators, Generators and List comprehension in Python.

* Q1.1 - An iterator class for prime number up to a given number.
* Q1.2 - A Generator function for prime number up to a given number.
* Q2 - List comprehension for all the divisors of a given number
* Q3 - List comprehension; All prime numbers between two given numbers
* Q4 - A Generator function that gets 2 integers and returns all even numbers between them, whose unity digit is a product of tens digits.
* Q5 - List comprehension; gets a string and returns a dictionary whose Keys are the strings' characters and Values are the number of occurences of each char in the string
* Q6 - A Generator function that gets 2 strings and compare each character by indices. It returns equal characters at the same index.
* Q7 - List comperhension; Build a new string from a list of indices and a list of characters, sorted by the list of indices.
* Q8 - A Generator function that gets 2 integers and returns all the nubmers between them; ascending order and then decending order. After each iteration the use can send a new number to the program.
